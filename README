Klassen Konferenz Planer (KKP)
Class Conference Planner (CCP)

You tell it which classes exist, which teachers do each class,
how many conferences can happen at any time and how many time
slots you have, and it tells you the possible arrangements.

Due to some optimizations being used here, only 255 teachers
can be at the school. If that limit needs to be increased,
pass `-Dteacher_limit=NUM` to `zig build`.
Same goes for the amount of classes, limited to 63. This can
be changed with `-Dclass_limit=NUM`.

Currently, even though a `-j` option is provided, this isn't
multithreaded. I might optimize in the future though.

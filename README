Klassen Konferenz Planer (KKP)
Class Conference Planner (CCP)

You tell it which classes exist, which teachers do each class,
how many conferences can happen at any time and how many time
slots you have, and it tells you the possible arrangements.

BUILDING

To build KKP/CCP, you need to have the zig compiler version
0.15.2 installed. You can get it here: ziglang.org.
After that, simply run `zig build` and it'll build it. The
binary should be installed at `zig-out/bin/KKP`.

This will be a debug build. If you want performance, run
`zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` instead.

USING

KKP/CCP takes a zon file as its input. Two examples can be
found in this repository, though to explain the schema:

The two most important fields are `room_count` and `time_slots`,
which dictate how many conferences can be held concurrently
and how many sequencially.
`not_available` contains a list of teachers that can be
ignored in the search because they can't participate anyway.
Lastly, `classes` is a list of classes, each with a name and
a mandatory and optional teachers list.

Currently, this program doesn't use the optional list.

Due to some optimizations being used, only 255 teachers
can be at the school. If that limit needs to be increased,
pass `-Dteacher_limit=NUM` to `zig build`.
Same goes for the amount of classes, limited to 63. This can
be changed with `-Dclass_limit=NUM`.

WARNING

This software is still in its infancy. Do not use this for
mission-critical applications.

TODO

- Improve performance by multithreading and whatever.
- Add code to handle optional teachers.
- Make better formatting for the output.
